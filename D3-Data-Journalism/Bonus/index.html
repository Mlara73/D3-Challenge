          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>
            Visually it can be seen a positive correlation between the Lacks Healthcare and Poverty rates. However, it is clear to see that Texas goes out of trend a bit, taking in count the high Lacks Healthcare Rate (17.2%). Another important insight to highlight is the case of Massachusetts, which presents a very low Lacks Healthcare Rate (4.6%). Finally, worth mentioning as well, that the highest poverty rate is represented by Mississippi and New Mexico state, with 21.5% and 21.3% respectively.
          </p>

          <p>There is no a defined correlation or trend between the Smokes (%) Rate VS Median Age; however, its important to highlight the case of the State of “Utah”, where the Median Age is between 30 and 31 years, and the Smokes Rate is only a 9.7%. On the other hand, it can be seen that “West Virginia” is the State with the highest Smokes Rate (26.7%).</p>

          <p>A negative correlation can be seen between the Median of Household Income VS the Obesity (%) rate. Here the State of Mississippi is the one that has the lowest Median Income, and one of the highest Obesity Rates (39,689 USD and 35.5% respectively). Aversely, Washington DC is the State where Household Income is high ($ 71,648), and Obesity Rate is lower in comparison to various states (21.7%).</p>
